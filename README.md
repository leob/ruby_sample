A simple demo/sample program that I wrote to build some Ruby skills.

The program does a recursive scan of a given directory and builds a tree out of that.
The contents of the tree can then be displayed in various ways.

I'm using it to extract the URLs from Linux .desktop files and write those into a text or html index.

Planning to build versions in various languages (node.js and so on) in 'polyglot' fashion.
